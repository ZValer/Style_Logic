# E4 Demonstration of a Programming Paradigm

## Description
Choose a useful problem to solve using a specific programming paradigm (App, ICPC, script).
Explain the context of the problem and why it is useful. 


Fashion is all around us. Since the moment we prepare ourselves to leave the house we have to choose what to wear. The selection is a representation of ourselves and what we want to show the world about us. The fashion industry is huge and has a big impact on what we wear and how we feel.   

The fashion industry is embracing technology in various ways to innovate and improve the design, production, and consumption of clothing and accessories. E-commerce platforms and mobile apps have improved their sales and the way they interact in various ways with the consumers.   

Imagine a program that helps you pick out outfits based on things like the weather, the colors you like, and where you're going. It could make getting dressed in the morning a whole lot easier and more fun, making fashion more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.



## Model of the Solution
Explain the logic of your solution in diagram and be specific about how the paradigm would be used.

### Logic Paradigm 
...

## Implementation
Implement your solution in a language that supports the programming paradigm.

### Implementation 1
For the first implementation, I followed the model as can be seen "style.py" fyle. 

To run the program in the terminal follow the instructions below:

> [!TIP]
> To test it in a terminal you need to go the folder with the file, write "python style.py".
> 
> Then put one of following queries and the program should return an outfit based on the restrictions. 
> % Example queries:
> % ?- outfit(Top, Outerwear, Bottoms, Footwear).
> % ?- outfit_weather(Top, Outerwear, Bottoms, Footwear, hot).
> % ?- outfit_formality(Top, Outerwear, Bottoms, Footwear, casual).
> % ?- outfit_weather_formality(Top, Outerwear, Bottoms, Footwear, hot, casual).
> 
### Implementation 2
For the second implementation,  I followed -- as can be seen "x.py" fyle. 

To run the program in the terminal follow the instructions below:

> [!TIP]
> To test it in a terminal you need to go the folder with the file, write "python ex.py".
> 
>Then put the query and the program should return ---
>

## Tests

To show that the implemented model works as intended and correctly solves the problem a set of documented tests are shown. 

### Regular Expression

The file "x.py" contains test cases for the x
> [!TIP]
>To test it in a terminal you need to go the folder with the file, write "pyhton test_x.py".
